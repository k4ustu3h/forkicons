Thanks for your contribution!

We hope that you followed [the Forkicons guidelines](https://github.com/k4ustu3h/forkicons/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and made sure that Forkicons is built correctly.

> [!Tip]
> While waiting for a brief and strict review from our team, you can do a self-review to ensure that your icons are suitable for Forkicons. Additionally, you can find and install [the debug build of your PR](https://github.com/k4ustu3h/forkicons/actions/workflows/build_debug_apk.yml).

### Forkicons guidelines

#### Quality

1. Ensure that icons are easily recognizable.
2. Align icons to [the visual center](https://crazybitsstudios.com/another-way-of-aligning-elements-when-creating-icons) as much as possible within the guidelines. The visual center is where your icon looks and feels centered.
3. Avoid noticable black spots.

#### Canvas and sizes

1. Canvas: `192×192px`.
2. Non-square icons: the long side of the icons should be `160px`.
3. Square icons: `154×154px`.

#### Color, stroke width and rounding

1. Color: black `#000`.

#### Naming

1. Names should match the official app name and contain no additional text.
2. If the first `3` characters of the app name contain letters not from the English alphabet, then add a localized (or transliterated) name via `~~`. Example: `京东 ~~ JD`.
3. The names of the drawables should repeat the names of the apps if nothing prevents it.
