**Forkicons** is a fork of [Lawnicons](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnicons), an icon pack developed by the Lawnchair team.
Originally an addon for Lawnchair 12 Alpha 5 and above to implement themed icons, it can now be used on many launchers. Some launchers may also support Forkicons for themed icons.

_Forkicons restores the original themed icons of apps and adds icons for apps that doesn't have one, instead of the outlined icons in the original Lawnicons._

Forkicons is best used on [Lawnchair 13](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair). You can enable themed icons on Lawnchair by going to `Home Settings > General > Icon Style > Themed Icons`, choosing "Home Screen" or "Home Screen and App Drawer".

This project is mostly supported by our community. If you wish to contribute, check out the Contributing section below.
